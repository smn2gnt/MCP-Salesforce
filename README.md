### Model Context Protocol

To use this server with the Model Context Protocol, you need to configure it in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file. Add the following entry to the `mcpServers` section:


    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "salesforce": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--from",
                "mcp-salesforce-connector",
                "salesforce"
            ],
            "env": {
                "SALESFORCE_USERNAME": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME",
                "SALESFORCE_PASSWORD": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD",
                "SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN": "YOUR_SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
Replace `YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME`, `YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`, and `YOUR_SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN` with your Salesforce credentials.
